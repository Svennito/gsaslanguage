    <section class="main-content">
      <p>gsaslanguage was developed out of the necessity to both automate and document Rietveld analysis of diffraction data. A script language accomplishes both: </p>

<ul>
<li>It allows to analyze many datasets with a pre-defined and reproducible Rietveld strategy</li>
<li>The source code of the script and the generated PDF files document what the refinement strategy, i.e. the parameter turn on sequence, was.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://lansce.lanl.gov/lujan/instruments/HIPPO.shtml">HIPPO</a> neutron time-of-flight diffractometer at LANSCE collects data in either five or 45 histograms (for texture analysis), so one basically always has to deal with a multi-pattern data analysis. With gsaslanguage that is done in a few minutes. Because HIPPO is also fairly close to the intense LANSCE neutron source (~ 8.9m), we can collect meaningful data in around a minute in many cases, which allows us to study e.g. phase transformation kinetics. In cases like this, we collect a few hundred runs for a given sample, see for instance our <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231151530413X">paper on UC2</a>. gsaslanguage is also useful for parametric studies, e.g. determination of the crystal structure as a function of temperature like various MAX phases with Michel Barsoum and his group (see e.g. this <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.82.174109">paper</a>). </p>

<p>While I use Luca Lutterotti's <a href="http://radiographema.eu/maud/">MAUD</a> for most texture analysis because it implements the more accurate WIMV method, in some cases I still use GSAS and the spherical harmonics ODF model. In cases like that, gsaslanguage comes in handy to control the analysis of close to 100 histograms with over 1,000 parameters. </p>

<p>Please reference <a href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?cg5186">my paper</a> when you use gsaslanguage for your project. Please let me know if there are problems - I am happy to help.</p>
