{"name":"gsaslanguage","tagline":"This script language allows to automate the analysis of diffraction data using the GSAS Rietveld package. Githib is the new home of gsaslanguage! ","body":"gsaslanguage was developed out of the necessity to both automate and document Rietveld analysis of diffraction data. A script language accomplishes both: \r\n* It allows to analyze many datasets with a pre-defined and reproducible Rietveld strategy\r\n* The source code of the script and the generated PDF files document what the refinement strategy, i.e. the parameter turn on sequence, was.\r\n\r\nThe [HIPPO](http://lansce.lanl.gov/lujan/instruments/HIPPO.shtml) neutron time-of-flight diffractometer at LANSCE collects data in either five or 45 histograms (for texture analysis), so one basically always has to deal with a multi-pattern data analysis. With gsaslanguage that is done in a few minutes. Because HIPPO is also fairly close to the intense LANSCE neutron source (~ 8.9m), we can collect meaningful data in around a minute in many cases, which allows us to study e.g. phase transformation kinetics. In cases like this, we collect a few hundred runs for a given sample, see for instance our [paper on UC2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231151530413X). gsaslanguage is also useful for parametric studies, e.g. determination of the crystal structure as a function of temperature like various MAX phases with Michel Barsoum and his group (see e.g. this [paper](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.82.174109)). \r\n\r\nWhile I use Luca Lutterotti's [MAUD](http://radiographema.eu/maud/) for most texture analysis because it implements the more accurate WIMV method, in some cases I still use GSAS and the spherical harmonics ODF model. In cases like that, gsaslanguage comes in handy to control the analysis of close to 100 histograms with over 1,000 parameters. \r\n\r\nPlease reference [my paper](http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?cg5186) when you use gsaslanguage for your project. Please let me know if there are problems - I am happy to help.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
