\begin{abstract} 
The commands of the \gl\hspace{0.5em}software are documented. The software utilizes the GSAS package and is intended to simplify automation of the analysis of large numbers of datasets, document refinement strategies and foster efficient exchange of refinement strategies between users and beam line scientists. Use of the bash shell and standard Unix text processing tools, available natively on Linux and Mac OSX platforms and via the free cygwin software on Windows systems, make this software platform independent.
